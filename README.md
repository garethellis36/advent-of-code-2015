My code for [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) 2015. I am doing the puzzles as TDD exercises using PHPSpec, inspired
by David Stockton's YouTube series. The first puzzle is essentially lifted from his solution - the others have been
all my own work.


To run a puzzle, simple type:
`php runner.php DayN PuzzleN`
