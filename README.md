My code for [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) 2015. I am doing the puzzles as TDD exercises using PHPSpec, inspired
by David Stockton's YouTube series. The first puzzle is essentially lifted from his solution - the others have been
all my own work (unless otherwise credited).

Note: my Day 24 code solution doesn't work - I managed to get the right answers using Excel, some simple
sums and some luck!

To run a puzzle, simple type:
`php runner.php DayN PuzzleN`
